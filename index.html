  <h4>1. A dish prepared by you in the kitchen:</h4>
  <p>I prepared Maggi noodles with vegetables. I added carrots, peas, and onions to make it tasty and healthy.</p>


  <h4>2. A life skill that you have just learned:</h4>
  <p>I learned how to ride a bicycle without support. It took practice and balance, but now I can ride confidently.</p>


  <h4>3. A story book you have read during the holidays:</h4>
  <p>I read <em>"The Night Train at Deoli"</em> by Ruskin Bond. It is a beautiful story about a young man's brief encounter with a girl at a small railway station.</p>

  <p>I visited Jaipur with my family. We saw the Amer Fort, Hawa Mahal, and enjoyed Rajasthani food.</p>
